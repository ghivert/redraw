//// To provide quality support for touch-based user interfaces, touch events
//// offer the ability to interpret finger (or stylus) activity on touch screens
//// or trackpads.
////
//// The touch events interfaces are relatively low-level APIs that can be used
//// to support application-specific multi-touch interactions such as a
//// two-finger gesture. A multi-touch interaction starts when a finger (or
//// stylus) first touches the contact surface. Other fingers may subsequently
//// touch the surface and optionally move across the touch surface. The
//// interaction ends when the fingers are removed from the surface. During this
//// interaction, an application receives touch events during the start, move,
//// and end phases.
////
//// Touch events are similar to mouse events except they support simultaneous
//// touches and at different locations on the touch surface. The `TouchEvent`
//// interface encapsulates all of the touchpoints that are currently active.
//// The [`Touch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Touch)
//// interface, which represents a single touchpoint, includes information such
//// as the position of the touch point relative to the browser viewport.
