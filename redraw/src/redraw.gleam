/// An `Element` can be a DOM node or the result of the execution of a
/// component. Any time you need to draw on the screen, whether it's in the
/// DOM or on your smartphone screen with React Native, you need to return an
/// `Element`.
///
/// > Be careful, a "component" in React is _a function which can create
/// > elements_. For example, `fn () -> Element` is a so-called "component".
/// > Contrarily to elements, a component can hold internal state, have a
/// > lifecycle and can run side-effects. On the opposite, elements do not hold
/// > state, and cannot have side-effects.
/// >
/// > Creating an `Element` is as simple as calling functions from
/// > `redraw/dom/html`, while creating copmonents can be done with
/// > [`component_`](#component_).

/// (if you're familiar with Erlang). Because Gleam cannot execute code outside of
/// `main` function, creating a context should do some side-effect at startup.
///
/// In traditional React code, Context usage is usually written like this.
///
/// ```javascript
/// import * as react from 'react'
///
/// // Create your Context in a side-effectful way.
/// const MyContext = react.createContext(defaultValue)
///
/// // Create your own provider, wrapping your context.
/// export function MyProvider(props) {
///   return <MyContext.Provider>{props.children}</MyContext.Provider>
/// }
///
/// // Create your own hook, to simplify usage of your context.
/// export function useMyContext() {
///   return react.useContext(MyContext)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// To simplify and mimic that usage, Redraw wraps Context creation with some
/// caching, to emulate a similar behaviour.
///
/// ```gleam
/// import redraw
///
/// const context_name = "MyContextName"
///
/// pub fn my_provider(children) {
///   let assert Ok(context) = redraw.create_context(context_name, default_value)

/// }
///
/// pub fn use_my_context() {
///   let assert Ok(context) = redraw.get_context(context_name)
///   redraw.use_context(context)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Be careful, `create_context` fails if the Context is already defined.
/// Choose a full qualified name, hard to overlap with inattention. If
/// you want to get a Context in an idempotent way, take a look at [`context()`](#context).
